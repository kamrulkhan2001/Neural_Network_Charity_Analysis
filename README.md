# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
In this analysis created a binary classifier to predict whether applicants to Alphabet Soup's charity program will be successful if they are funded.We worked with a dataset containing metadata for over 34,000 organizations who have received funding from Alphabet Soup in the past.We preprocessed the data for a neural network modeled, then compiled, trained and evaluated the model and finally optimized the model to try and achieve a predictive accuracy of 75% or higher.


## Summary

In summary, the results of the 4 models we ran did not achieve the goal of getting the predictive accuracy to over 75%. Since this project is a binary classification problem, I would recommend trying the SVM model. SVMs have advantages over neural network/deep learning models when it comes to binary as SVMs excel at classifying and creating regression using two groups. Additionally, SVMs are less likely to overfitting as it looks at maximizing the distance not working with all data within the boundry.
